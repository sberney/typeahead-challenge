/*
 * Using React create a `Typeahead` component that takes `list` and `classname` props.
 * Be sure that the component utilizes propTypes and any other best practices
 * that you follow. Use the `carBrands` list which is defined below as the
 * value for the `list` prop.
 *
 * Ensure that your component meets the following requirements:
 * 1. As the user types in an input field, a list of options should appear below it.
 *    - The list should only appear when input is not empty. Whitespace is
 *      considered empty.
 *    - The list should contain items from the `list` prop that *start*
 *      with the user entered value. Matching should be case insensitive.
 *    - Every new character typed should filter the list.
 * 2. Clicking on a list item should populate the input with the selected item's
 *    value and hide the list.
 * 3. For visible option strings, style the substring the user has entered as
 *    *bold*.
 * 4. Highlight a list item with gray background and white
 *    text when the user mouses over it.
 * 5. The input and list should be navigable using the keyboard.
 *    - Using `tab` and `shift+tab`, the user should be able to focus the different
 *      list items.
 *        - With the cursor in the input, pressing the `tab` key should focus the
 *          first item with the default browser focus style.
 *        - Subsequent presses of the "tab" key should focus the next item in the list.
 *        - Pressing the `shift+tab` keys should focus the previous item in the list.
 *        - Pressing the `shift+tab` key when the first item is focused should focus
 *          the input again.
 *        - Mousing over other list items should highlight them while the keyboard-
 *          focused item remains focused.
 *        - Pressing the `tab` key when no list is visible should move focus away
 *          from the input.
 *    - Pressing the `return` key when an item is focused should populate the input
 *      with the focused item's value, hide the list, and focus the input
 *      again.
 *    - Pressing the `escape` key should close the list.
 * 6. Clicking outside the input or the list should close the list.
